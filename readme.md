# React Native Playground 🧪

A personal laboratory where I explore the **React Native** ecosystem. This repository is a collection of various mini-projects, standalone experiments, and UI/UX prototypes.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I expand my cross-platform expertise beyond Flutter. It serves as a "sandbox" for:

- **Technical Exploration:** Testing out React Native core features, hooks, and native modules.
- **UI Lab:** Building custom components, styling patterns, and animations.
- **Library Evaluation:** Hands-on experience with popular packages (Zustand, Reanimated, etc.).
- **Comparative Learning:** Analyzing architectural differences between Flutter and React Native.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This is a **multi-project repository**. Each folder represents a standalone React Native project or a specific exploration with its own configuration and dependencies.

> **Note:** Since this is a playground, you may find various coding styles and "work-in-progress" experiments as I iterate through different concepts.
